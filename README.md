# To-Do-List Using vanilla JavaScript

> The to-do list has a beautiful UI, the user can add a to-do by filling the input and hit ENTER, after that he can rather check the to-do when it's done, or remove it using the delete button.

> The user's to-do list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, he can always find the list there.

> There is the possibility for the user, to clear the list, by clicking the button clear, at the top right corner of our app.
